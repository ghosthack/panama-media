/**
 * Decoded image data returned by panama-media modules.
 * <p>
 * The {@code pixels} segment is valid for the lifetime of the {@code Arena}
 * that was passed to the decode method. The caller owns the Arena and
 * controls when the memory is freed.
 * <p>
 * The type parameter {@code PF} is the pixel format enum for the module.
 * Most modules use {@link PixelFormat} (RGBA, RGB, RGB16). Modules with
 * domain-specific formats define their own enums implementing
 * {@link BasePixelFormat}.
 * <p>
 * The {@code orientation} field carries the source image's EXIF orientation
 * tag (TIFF tag 0x0112). Values are {@code 1}–{@code 8} per the EXIF
 * specification; {@code 1} means "no rotation" and is also the TIFF-defined
 * default when the tag is absent — this is what producers return for
 * un-tagged inputs so consumers can branch on orientation uniformly without
 * a separate "is it set?" check.
 * <p>
 * Producers that already bake the transform into the returned pixels still
 * report the source tag value, so downstream encoders can re-embed it or
 * consumers can record it as metadata without re-opening the source.
 * <p>
 * {@link #ORIENTATION_UNSET} ({@code 0}) is reserved as a sentinel for
 * callers / APIs that need to disambiguate "tag truly absent" from "tag
 * present with value 1"; in normal pipelines nothing emits it and consumers
 * don't need to handle it.
 *
 * @param <PF>        the pixel format enum (must implement {@link BasePixelFormat})
 * @param pixels      raw pixel data
 * @param width       image width in pixels
 * @param height      image height in pixels
 * @param stride      bytes per row (may be larger than width * bytes-per-pixel
 *                    due to alignment padding)
 * @param format      pixel format of the data
 * @param orientation EXIF orientation in {@code [1, 8]} ({@code 1} is the
 *                    TIFF default / "no rotation"), or
 *                    {@link #ORIENTATION_UNSET} ({@code 0}) as an opt-in
 *                    "tag truly absent" sentinel
